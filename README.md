# HackInStyle
This repository contains all code [front-end and back-end] that will help in the building of the personal website/blog. 
The website will allow users to know me better and to access my own personal blogs. 

The blogs will cover various interesting topics such as life, computer science, scientific topics and anything that comes up to mind.
